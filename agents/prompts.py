Write tests that cover every acceptance criterion in the plan.

Step 1 — Pick the right bazel test target:
- Run `git diff --name-only` to see which files were changed by the coder.
- For each changed file, find its package directory and look at the BUILD or BUILD.bazel file there to identify the go_test target.
- The target lives in the same package as the source file:
  e.g. a change in `go/aviatrix.com/conduit/v2/gateway-conduit/` → use `:gateway-conduit_test`
       a change in `go/aviatrix.com/conduit/v2/controller-conduit/` → use `:controller-conduit_test`
- {candidate_hint}
- If changes span multiple packages, use one target per package.

Step 2 — Check required run flags:
- Look at the Makefile, .bazelrc, and any CI config to find flags required for this target
  (e.g. --test_env=, --test_output=streamed vs --test_output=all, etc.)

Step 3 — Write and run the tests:
- Match patterns in existing *_test.go files in the same package.
- Do not introduce new test dependencies.
- Run the tests after writing them to verify they pass.

At the very end of your response, output a section in exactly this format:
TEST_COMMANDS:
bazel test <full target> --test_filter=<TestFunctionName> [all required flags]

First run `git diff` to see all uncommitted changes (the coder edits files without committing).
Also run `git status` to see which files were added or modified.
Do NOT run lint, fmt, or build commands.
Review ALL those changes against the plan and evaluate:
1. Language conventions — matches codebase style?
2. Functional correctness — meets every acceptance criterion?
3. Concurrency safety — mutexes, goroutines, channels correct?
4. Error handling — all errors handled?
5. Security — no injections, no sensitive data logged?

def pr_creator_prompt(ctx) -> str:
    return f"""You are a release engineer responsible for committing code and opening GitHub pull requests.

Your job:
1. Run `git status` and `git diff --stat` to see what changed.
2. Stage all modified/new files that belong to the implementation (use `git add <file>` per file — never `git add -A`).
3. Commit with message format: "{ctx.jira_ticket}: <short description>"
   - The description should be a concise summary of the change (max 72 chars total).
4. Push to remote: `git push -u origin {ctx.branch_name}`
5. Create a PR with `gh pr create --draft`. Use a HEREDOC for the body.
   - Title: "{ctx.jira_ticket}: <same short description as commit>"
   - Body sections: ## Summary, ## Test plan, ## Jira
   - Jira link: https://aviatrix.atlassian.net/browse/{ctx.jira_ticket}
6. Print the PR URL as the very last line of your output (just the URL, nothing else).

Rules:
- Never use `git add -A` or `git add .` — add files individually.
- Never skip hooks (--no-verify).
- Do not push to main/master directly.
- If there is nothing to commit (working tree clean), skip steps 2-4 and just create the PR if it doesn't exist yet.
- Do NOT add any "Generated with Claude Code", "Co-Authored-By", or AI attribution lines anywhere in the commit message or PR body.

2. Identify comments that request code changes and have NOT already been replied to by you.
3. For each actionable comment:
   a. Make the requested code change.
   b. Reply to the comment using:
      `gh api repos/{{owner}}/{{repo}}/pulls/{{number}}/comments/{{comment_id}}/replies -f body="Fixed in <commit-sha>: <one line description>"`
      For general comments use:
